  <h2> Cards </h2>

<p>
  Cards in the game have different rarities: 1, 2, 3, or 4 Stars.
  In addition to that, some 4 star cards are limited cards while others are permanent cards.
  The main way to obtain cards in the game is by spending your Crystals on Gachas.
</p>

<p>
  Features cards have are:
  <ul>
    <li>Level</li>
    <li>Skill</li>
    <li>Talent</li>
    <li>Untrained and Trained Art</li>
    <li>Costumes</li>
    <li>Mastery</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  When you get a card, it always starts at level 1 and you can play shows or use practice scores to level up your cards.
  Different rarities have different MAX card levels.
  Level 20 for 1 star, Level 30 for 2 star, Level 50 for 3 star (with upgrade), and Level 60 for 4 star (with upgrade).
</p>

<p>
  Every card has a skill related to <a href="p3.html">gameplay</a>and skill level.
  When you get a card, it always starts with a skill level of 1.
  Skills can include Recovery (gaining Health), Accuracy, and Score Up.
</p>

<p>
  Cards have Talent, which can influence your Score during <a href="p3.html">gameplay</a>.
  There are a lot of factors that affect a card's talent but generally, you can increase a card's talent by leveling it up and upgrading it.
</p>

<p>
  Every 3 star and 4 star card has Untrained Art and Trained Art.
  To unlock trained art, you upgrade the card.
  Here is an example of untrained and trained art.
</p>

<div>

<img style="display:inline; width: 40%;" src="./images/akitotrained.webp" alt="Image of trained art">
</div>

<p>
  Every 4 star also has a costume, which you can equip on the 3D models of the characters.
  The costume is basically the costume the character wears in the trained art.
  Along with costumes, limited cards also have hairstyles, which can only be unlocked by upgrading the Mastery of the card.
</p>

<p>
  Increasing Mastery increases the Talent of the card and can unlock hairstyles used to dress the 3D models of the characters.
