<h2> Groups/Characters </h2>
<p>
  In Hatsune Miku: Colorful Stage Project Sekai, there are different groups with different stories. There are the <a href="https://projectsekai.fandom.com/wiki/VIRTUAL_SINGER"> VIRTUAL SINGERS </a> which are vocaloids, and then there are 5 groups of fictional characters, each with their own themes and stories.
  </p>
  <p> The groups' names are Leoneed, MORE MORE JUMP!, Vivid Bad Squad, Wonderlands x Showtime, and Nightcord 25:00. Each group/team has 4 people, except for the VIRTUAL SINGERS, who have 6 people, including Hatsune Miku, Megurine Luka, Kagamine Rin, Kagamine Len, KAITO, and MEIKO. There are events and stories for individual characters as well as whole groups where you can see their growth through their fictional story that the producers of the game (SEGA) created.

<h2> Songs </h2>
<p>
  In Hatsune Miku: Colorful Stage Project Sekai, there is a vast library of songs that you can choose from. There are songs that were commissioned specifically for the game and centered around the characters' stories and there are also covers of already existing songs that the Vocaloids and voice actors for the characters sing.

  For each song in the game, there are 5 levels of difficulty (on the global server): Easy, Normal, Hard, Expert, and Master. Each level has an assigned number for difficulty. There are some songs that are very hard (with Master level difficulty of over 30) and some that are easy (with Master level diffucilty of around 26).
