    <h2> What's the Game About? </h2>

    <p>
      Hatsune Miku: Colorful Stage Project Sekai, also called Project Sekai for short, is a moblie rhythm game available on iOS and Android.
      The game offers single player and multi-player <a href="p3.html">gameplay</a>, a wide variety of <a href="p2.html">songs</a>, as well as fictional <a href="p1.html">characters</a>, storylines, and events written by the developers of the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game has 4 servers: Japanese, Taiwanese, Korean, and English (also known as the Global server).
      The servers offer all of the same stories and gameplay (except for the Japanese server, which releases everything one year ahead of the others).
      The main difference is that subtitles are in different languages, although all vocals and songs are still in Japanese.
