  In Project Sekai, there are fictional characters in fictional groups with fictional storylines.
  Different groups have focuses on different aesthetics and genres of music. The groups in the game are VIRTUAL SINGERS, Leoneed, MORE MORE JUMP, Vivid Bad Squad, WonderlandsxShowtime, and Nightcord 25:00.
  The VIRTUAL SINGERS are the only group not unique to the game, as they are a group of Vocaloids that are also popular outside the Project Sekai community.
  Every character in the game, except for the VIRTUAL SINGERS because they are Vocaloids, has a voice actor that sings and speaks in stories.
