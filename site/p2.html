  <h2> Songs </h2>

<p>
  Project Sekai offers a wide range of songs.
  The available songs in the game can be commissioned songs that were made for specific events or they can be covers done by the voice actors in the game or by the Vocaloids.
  You can find a list of all the songs in the game <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjMsKXczrCEAxXfjYkEHYKICksQFnoECBwQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fprojectsekai.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FSong_List&usg=AOvVaw3IcC4tN_1BxG5yuoxW10nK&opi=89978449">here</a>.
  Every song has 5 difficulty levels for <a href="p3.html">gameplay</a>: Easy, Normal, Hard, Expert, Master. Each level of difficulty for every song also has an assigned number of difficulty.
  The hardest song in the game is called "<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi9uqLHz7CEAxWtk4kEHfAzDCQQFnoECAcQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fprojectsekai.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FWhat%2527s_up%253F_Pop!&usg=AOvVaw3kByVIGf9JgvcBqpHBOC7K&opi=89978449">What's up? Pop!</a>".
</p>

<p>
  Each <a href="p1.html">group</a> has its own genre of music that they focus around. Cover songs and commissioned songs typically revolve or are related to each group's aesthetic.
  There are also currently 4 songs that were commissioned for the game's anniversary that are sung by the leaders of each group instead of being sung by just one group.
  Select songs also have 2D and/or 3D music videos.
