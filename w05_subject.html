<h2> What's the Game About? </h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.colorfulstage.com/">Hatsune Miku: Colorful Stage Project Sekai</a> (also called Project Sekai for short) is a mobile rhythm game available on iOS and Android. The game is published by the company Sega. It offers multi-player as well as single-player rhythm gameplay with fictional characters, storylines, and events. The game offers a wide variety of songs from different genres. The game is produced in Japanese, so most songs (with an exception to songs in English commissioned for the global server) are in Japanese, along with voices in stories and events.
</p>
  <p> There are different servers of the game (global (English), Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese). All servers still have Japanese vocals, but have subtitles in different languages.

<h2> Groups/Characters </h2>

  In Hatsune Miku: Colorful Stage Project Sekai, there are different groups with different stories. There are the <a href="https://projectsekai.fandom.com/wiki/VIRTUAL_SINGER"> VIRTUAL SINGERS </a> which are vocaloids, and then there are 5 groups of fictional characters, each with their own themes and stories.
  </p>
  <p> The groups' names are Leoneed, MORE MORE JUMP!, Vivid Bad Squad, Wonderlands x Showtime, and Nightcord 25:00. Each group/team has 4 people, except for the VIRTUAL SINGERS, who have 6 people, including Hatsune Miku, Megurine Luka, Kagamine Rin, Kagamine Len, KAITO, and MEIKO. There are events and stories for individual characters as well as whole groups where you can see their growth through their fictional story that the producers of the game (SEGA) created.
