    <h2> What's the Game About? </h2>

    <p>
      Hatsune Miku: Colorful Stage Project Sekai, also called Project Sekai for short, is a moblie rhythm game available on iOS and Android.
      The game offers single player and multi-player <a href="p3.html">gameplay</a>, a wide variety of <a href="p2.html">songs</a>, as well as fictional <a href="p1.html">characters</a>, storylines, and events written by the developers of the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game has 4 servers: Japanese, Taiwanese, Korean, and English (also known as the Global server).
      The servers offer all of the same stories and gameplay (except for the Japanese server, which releases everything one year ahead of the others).
      The main difference is that subtitles are in different languages, although all vocals and songs are still in Japanese.

      Player Rank is the rank of the player (you).
      Character Rank is available for all the fictional characters of the game. You can upgrade Character Ranks through certain actions.
      There are a wide variety of cards for different characters that have different rarities (1 to 4 stars) and certain cards can be obtained through certain Gachas.
      Crystals are, fundamentally, the "currency" in the game and can be used on Gachas to get cards.
